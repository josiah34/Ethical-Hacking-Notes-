Vulnerability- in cybersecurity is defined as a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application.


****************************************FIVE MAIN CATEGORIES**************************************************************************

Operating System | These types of vulnerabilties are found within Operating Systems and often result in privilege escalation. 

Misconfiguration-based | These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. 

Weak or Default Credentials | Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example a website has
an administrator login portal with username and password set to "admin".

Application Logic | These vulnerabilties are a result of poorly design applications. For example an authentication mechanism that is poorly designed and allows someone to
impersonate a valid user. 

Human-Factor | These are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example a phishing email that tricks the receiver into believing that its legitimate.
